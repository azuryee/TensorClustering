## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

*used the Authors@R field to declare authors and maintainer.

*Replaced \dontrun with \donttest for examples that are not executable in < 5 sec.


## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.5
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was one NOTE:

** checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
  
  New submission
